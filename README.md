# banao_notes_app

A new Flutter project which is a 3rd shortlisting task of Banao Technology.

In this task we have to build a Notes Application using Flutter Bloc package and proper repository pattern. In this we can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. Users can log in with their email ids. The data will be stored in firebase.
